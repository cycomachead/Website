**cycomachead - version 1.1**

So, I've gotten around to doing some cleanup I've wanted to do for a while. Mobile viewing will be much better now, and things shouldn't overlap at all on small screens or low resolution displays. I've also made minor changes to various other parts of the site. If you would like to add a link to the Home Screen on your iPhone or iPad (or iPod touch too) I've now created a special icon for that.

*…one more thing:*

Comments! I've added comments. So, now I guess this is a real bona-fide blog (if there is such a thing). I'd love to hear what you think, and comments should make that much easier. So, please, say hello. :)
