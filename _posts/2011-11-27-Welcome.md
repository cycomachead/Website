Well, there is it! I've finally gotten a new site together. Actually, I think it speaks for itself at this point so there isn't too much to say. My previous site was OK, but hosting on my old laptop wasn't the greatest idea for reliability. So, welcome!

What's new? Well, I've got a new layout, a better format, more links to everything. Oh and Tumblr. Yep, this a blog, but that's honestly not my main focus. I simply want to share what I'm working on right now. So, please, check my links to the side, or [drop me a line](mailto:cycomachead@gmail.com) and let me know what you think!

P.S. This site isn't quite finished, so do expect some changes for a while, or forever! If you're curious I'm looking to add better features to share individual posts, maybe have a sticky post, and who knows what else. I'll always be adding to the [Photography](/photography) page too.
