Wheeler Hall has a reputation on campus, especially within the last two years. Initially, everyone has mixed feeling because Wheeler Hall is home to UC Berkeley's largest lecture hall where we've all spent plenty of time in both good and bad classes. However, recently, Wheeler has a sense of excitement around it. Since the UC financial crisis began in 2009, Wheeler Hall has been the place for many gatherings, protests, and other (not so great) incidents. It's one place on campus where there's always something going on.
