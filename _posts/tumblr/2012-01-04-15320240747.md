Taken from the top of the Duomo (Cathedral) in Florence. I walked all the around the top and took around 40 shots, but there's a bit less resolution because I overlapped quite a bitâ€¦

If you get a chance please try and view the large version on Flickr and zoom in. It looks neat to see everything in detail from a bird's eye view!
