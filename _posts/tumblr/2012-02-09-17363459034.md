Space is definitely a premium in Rome, and though the buildings are no where near the height of sky scrapers, looking up at the many obelisks gives a feeling of being closed in despite the semi-open spaces. This is the Solare or Obelisk of Montecitorio, located just past the Piazza de Spanga which is home to the famous Spanish Steps.
