It's interesting how in Italy quite a few wineries want to produce wines &#8220;the new way&#8221; with more control and technology like is done with modern wineries in California. Argenteria winery fairly recently renovated much place and built an amazing new cave for all their barrels to age in. <br/><br/>

If there were a way to have smell-o-vision, this photo needs it! :)</p>
