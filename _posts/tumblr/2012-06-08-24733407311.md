Just after classes ended my friends and I spent a day exploring San Francisco and our last stop with the Golden Gate. (It was also the furthest point from downtown.) The skies were nice a blue, and relatively clear, but surprise surprise, there was a layer of Bay Area Fog to deal with. Still, the bridge at night is a great sight!
