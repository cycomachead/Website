Home for the next few years! :)

According the rumor/legend/fond story of tour guides, that road was left open so that in the event of an earthquake if the Campanile were to fall down, it would just slide down the road.
    
We all know that it's not going to fall, and if it did, that wouldn't happen, but it's a fun story!
