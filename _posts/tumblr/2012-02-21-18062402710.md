This Monorail is making it's journey around the Lagoon! I'll let you see if you can guess which one it is. :)

So, today I went to a presentation at Berkeley which talked about Ansel Adams involvement with the UC and the collection of 6,700 which they are going to scan and share with students! I'm pretty darn excited, and since I was in a B&W mood, I thought I'd try it for today's shot!
