Well, this is one of those times where you pack the extra lens (the heavy 70-200 in this case) and are really glad you did! :) While at Zion we found this female Broad-tailed Hummingbird (or Selasphorus platycercus if you really wanted to know), and she wasn't really afraid to get close to the camera. It's amazing how fast they move because we were in very bright daylight and I was only at f/10 - and the wings are still a bit blurry. I'm very happy to have been borrowing the 1D Mark IV at that time because the speed of the AF system really came in handy! I didn't do much to this shot except for a bit of a crop and boosting the color in Aperture a bit.
