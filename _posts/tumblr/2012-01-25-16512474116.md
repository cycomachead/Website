One of my newest fascinations with Berkeley is Hearst Memorial Mining Building. It's a pretty cool building, especially for photographers! I spent about an hour or so in the entrance to the building the other day, and will go back again sometime soon. I'm also going to use it as a great place to teach some people who are interested in photography, too. :)
