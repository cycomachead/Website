If you follow Hyde Street to North Beach you'll end up at Hyde Street Pier which was once used a ferry dock among other things. Today, it's home to a great collection of historic ships and other maritime artifacts, and great views! Behind the sign is the ship [Eureka.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_(1890))
