Take your pick of which way you'd like to go!

This was during setup of one of our high school rallies. They're quite a large production and these arrows (which represent one color for each class) were part of a 5 or so foot sign. I loved the colors of all of them laying there, especially against the bright red mats which lined the gym floor.
