2 Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, CA.

Embarcadero Center has a very odd, yet very cool design as it spans 3 or 4 levels high over a period of about 4 small blocks stuck in the middle of the Financial District. This is one of the many many curvy staircases which are scattered all across Embarcadero Center.
