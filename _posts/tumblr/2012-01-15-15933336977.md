The tea cups are an excellent ride at Disneyland! Not only because they're fun to spin as fast as possible, but they also make excellent photos at night when playing with long exposure.

This was made standing outside the attraction in one of the viewing areas, and was a 3 exposure shot which I merged in Photomatix (though clearly it isn't an HDR photo by definition).
