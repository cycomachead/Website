Woods Cove was an amazing little find in Laguna Beach! It's rocky, but pretty spacious, and easy to get to. Because it's Southern California, it's also lovely even in winter, when this shot was made.

This was a 3 shot exposure which I merged with Photomatix and the used Aperture for some additional work. Mostly a vignette, and adding a bit of contrast, and darkening the rocks.
