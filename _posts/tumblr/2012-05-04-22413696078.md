Wow! I finally got a chance to get down to Fort Point. That was amazing! It took more than 10 miles of walking throughout the day, but it was totally worth ending the year walking through SF with friends. (Also, it turns out, the bus to Fort Point wasn't running last weekend, though this led to a couple shots I would have otherwise missed, so that was good.)
