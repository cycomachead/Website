The Embarcadero in San Francisco runs along the water and while sections of it are a little, wellâ€¦ sketchy, it's an amazing walk to see views of the bay. Fortunately, the Ferry Building is a great sport, because not only is it probably one of the least sketchy places in the city, but it's filled with excellent food and gift shops!

This was a hand held 3 short HDR which went through Photomatix and Aperture.
