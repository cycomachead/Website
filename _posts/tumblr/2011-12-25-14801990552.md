This is definitely a benefit of Berkeley, BART and good breaks!

The Pier 39 tree is pretty awesome to see and there's great views of it from everywhere, including the bridge to a parking structure (though most people seemed to pass this view up, until I set down the tripod...)

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays everyone! :)
