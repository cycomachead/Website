Many years ago, I had the opportunity to go the Catalina Island Marine Institute with school, way back in 7th and 8th grade. Not only was this great for just enjoying scenery and learning, but my science teacher was also a wedding photographer. I owe him at lot for really pushing my interest in photography, and doing awesome things- like helping me develop a couple rolls of film! :)
