By now, it should be no secret that I love Hearst Mining Building at Berkeley! Built in 1902 this is one of the older buildings on campus which has a very cool stone look, and one of the few with real wood for decoration. It just has one of those "academic" feelings, like real learning is supposed to be going on there.
