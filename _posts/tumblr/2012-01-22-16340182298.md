This was made as I turned around to leave the Court of Angles at Disneyland. In some ways, it was a type of happy accident because I wanted to see how the light would turn out, but I didn't really have time to compose much of a shot since we were on the way out, rushing to get to somewhere..Plus, this was with my 70-200 f.2.8L and handheld which isn't generally a very good combo at night!
