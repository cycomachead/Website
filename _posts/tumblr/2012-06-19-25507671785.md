Here's a proper shot of the Carthay Circle Theater - and before the craziness of the 15th. It looks great and it really Flo's well with all the new improvements (see what i did there?) and is already a DLR icon if you ask me. The 15th was great by the way but I have yet to go through photos because apparently I've been taking too many lately and I needed to upgrade my hard drive. :O Now that that's done hopefully I post a few soon. :)
