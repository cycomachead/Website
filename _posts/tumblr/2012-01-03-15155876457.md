A couple days ago a friend and I decided to head out to Laguna Beach and try some long exposures.

This shot was done as a 3 exposure HDR in Photomatix and a bit of work in Aperture. I love both the B&W and the color version of this image, and while I was playing around with both this crazy idea got stuck in my head and now you see the result. I'm not sure it's my absolute favorite version, but the juxtaposition of colors is keeping eyes and mind on this shot! :)
