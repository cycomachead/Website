It's been raining a lot here lately, and that's all the more reason to go out and take some photos! I really wish this courtyard had a name, but it's a very cool place to walk through (and quite convenient too).

This was a 3 shot HDR which went through Photomatix, and had the colors and contrast improved in Aperture.
