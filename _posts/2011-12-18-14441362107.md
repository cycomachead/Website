If you haven't ever been, it's the most freaky/amazing feeling walking around stairs which aren't parallel!

However, I do have a word of caution: Slippery when wet! As you may have been able to tell by the sky it was raining that day. Awesome sky, not so awesome on the top of an old and titled marble building. :-)
