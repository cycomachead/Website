This is was taken a couple weeks ago, well after park closing while we were hanging out as long as possible. :) There’s always so many fun shots of this place, especially in the dark! Not to mention, it was while I was still borrowing a 1D Mark IV, which is honestly a beast! It’s a very fun camera, and capable of amazing things, but way out of my league!
