I'm always amazed by Bugs Land when I actually spend the time to stop and look at the detail. It's pretty amazing how well the imagineers were able to completely change the scale of life. I think this shot helps capture that because not only do things already seem out of proportion, but with the hotel in the background, it really appears much smaller than it actually is.
