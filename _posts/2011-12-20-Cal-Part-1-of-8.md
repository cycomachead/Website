Reducing college to 8 semesters feels weird, but kind of exciting. Things do move pretty quickly!

So, what's happened? Lots! Though most of it was reading, projects, and other homework, naturally. It turns out the classes you expect to be easy aren't, and the hard ones are still hard. (This is Cal, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.)

**Computer Science @ Cal**

Cal is without a doubt one of the most amazing places to study computer science! I've lost count of the free meals, shirts, and other things from companies which really do want to give jobs and internships to students. It's awesome, and no college student will ever turn dan free stuff. :)

I've also had the opportunity to work on a project to solve the game [KenKen](http://www.kenken.com). KenKen is similar to Sudoku, but instead of matching based on boxes, you have a cage which has a total value and a math operation to get to that value. It turns out, that in your first few months of a programming class, this is REALLY difficult. Some of this may have been more difficult because of our programming interface [BYOB](http://byob.berkeley.edu), but that's a different issue. BYOB, by the way, is a pretty amazing way to do visual programming using "blocks" and dragging them in as you'd like to create really complex programs without getting bogged down in syntax. If you're at all interested in programming, check it out! 

**My Website – (like This page…)**

So, when solving KenKen got particularly crazy and difficult, I decided to finally get a new site up and running. It's definitely no where near finished, but in the meantime, I hope you're linking what I've done so far. Doing a photo a day is harder than it sounds, but it's starting to pick up! :) As for the future, I promise I'll post more, and comments should be coming soon!
