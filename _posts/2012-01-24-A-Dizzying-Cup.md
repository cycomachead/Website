I love playing with long exposures and the tea cups! This one was hard to do as I wanted. I really wanted a photo from a tea cup with light blur, that would have no other motion than the circular motion of a tea cup. This one came out pretty well, though there is a slight shake evident in a couple of the lights. It was also tough to get a good balance of the lights with the tea cup spinning asynchronously from the platform, but I do like the affect it had on 'looping' the green and pink lights.
