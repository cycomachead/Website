The change log mostly for personal interest right to keep track of the site
progress over the years, but I figured I might as well make it available for
anyone who is interested. I'll make sure each version will have the date I
push the changes, and features will be followed by the date I added them to
the list. Features with** are the ones that I'm putting priority into
working on either because they're easy or because it's something I really
want to do or need to do (since IE testing doesn't count as desirable).
However, features can happen in any order I want--It's my site! :-)

P.S. If you want to see something on the site, or notice something wrong,
please send me a note and let me know!
