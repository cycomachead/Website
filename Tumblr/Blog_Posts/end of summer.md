# The End of Summer

Well, let's just say this summer has been far far far more busy than I anticipated, and that's mainly the reason for my incredible lack of updates...though I have finally posted a new photo!

I'm not going to lie: I'm ready for classes to start. It's not that this summer hasn't be  awseome, because it most certainly has, but trying to do four jobs plus work on personal projects turns out to be a bit much. (Yes, I'm crazy...but, hey, you knew that!)

Technically, most of my work for the summer still has yet to be finished. Processing videos for an online class is much more work than I expected it to be. However, CSW10 starts in a few days and my videos are going to be there! (It's going to be an excellent semester, by the way, so if you need a class check it out!) Hopefully, these get finished soon becuase prepping for a new semester and a record number of sections is already taking it's own bit of time.

Speaking of the number of sections, things have gotten insane lately. CS10 will have a record number of sections at 11 this semester (including W10), but CS61A will have a mind-boggling 22, and no, that was not a typo. Good luck to the staff of 61A who are also running an awesome class! It was a blast working with everyone this summer, and was great to be kept on my toes while holding (way too many) office hours.

Well, it seems like my flight will be descending soon, and I'll need to finish this...
Thanks everyone for an awesome summer and Good Luck this fall! I promise I will _try_ to keep up with the site updates!
