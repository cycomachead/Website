A completely unexpected surprise during our trip to Italy this summer was the timing of their 150th year of Italian Unification. It was pretty cool to go during a week of national pride and celebration, including this fun shot. While walking around St. Mark's Square one morning we got a very cool fly over! These plans were relatively low (this was only at 70mm) and flew over us two or three times.
