Whether you're scared out of your mind, or having the time of your life, California Screamin was very aptly named!

This was made from Micky's Fun Wheel, and I'm glad I brought my 70-200! It's a shot that I've wanted to try for a while, and I'm glad they let me bring the lens in the park as white Canon zooms tend to get questioned…


P.S. Does anyone else think it'd be totally cool to have a camera mounted at the end of the blue overhang and get a burst of the train coming straight at you? (Especially if you could do it at the launch site…) Though I doubt there's any way they'd ever let a camera be mounted there in a million years!
