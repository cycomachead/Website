The *Duomo* is the Italian word for Cathedral, every large city, and most smaller ones have one. In Florence you can go to the top of the Dome as well at that tower which you can see, though the Dome provides much more interesting views of the city, and from a greater height, the downside is that there isn't an elevator.
