There's nothing like the detail of old buildings in Venice (and other parts of Europe)! The Doges' Palace is the place where the Doges (who were the rulers of Venice long ago) lived and met. Inside is even more interesting, though photography is a bit limited inside because they'd like to preserve everything.
